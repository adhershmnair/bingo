            First you have to find opponents to start a game with.
            For that you need to go to the Play tab from the navigation menu at the top.
            There you will see the users registered to this site aith their online/offline status
            [green and red by color respectively].
            Then send a request to the desired opponent.
            You will be redirected to your game logs and you'll see your game request status and the history of your previous games if any exists.
            If the desired opponent accepts your game request you'll see the game in your game log and a play button will appear beside that game.
            Click that button and you'll be redirect to the main game panel.
            This panel contains of a game board and a chat panel.
            You and your opponent will get different boards as a result you don't know each others board info.
            Example initial board given on the right -

            <p style="font-size:17px;">
              Now you can have a conversation with your opponent and play the game as well.
              The game board will be populated with numbers from 1 to 25 randomly.
              Initially all the grids of the board are white that means unmarked.
              Now from a random toss one of you and your opponent is selected as the player to give the first shot.
              Then players will be selecting any not selected numbers turn by turn.

            You have to make total 5 lines containing 5 grids with any combination of horizontal, vertical or diagonal before your opponent.
            Example winning board given on the left

          <h2 class="subtitle">Things to Remember</h2>

          <p style="font-size:17px;">
            As you and your opponent are getting different boards, you don't know each other's board positions.
            When you select a number on your board, that number will be selected on your opponent's board also.
            So, your selection is crucial not only for you, but also your opponent and vice versa.
          </p>
